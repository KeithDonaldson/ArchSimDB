## Running the server

* Clone the git repo
* Make sure you have the dependencies installed (all done through pip): Flask, pandas, matplotlib, and Werkzeug.
* Run the following command: `python3 main.py`. **Note**: This program writes files, so you may need to run as root.
* Navigate to the localhost link shown in Python output, usually 127.0.0.1:5000.

## Using the server

* Choose a .txt file to upload from the `data` folder. **Warning**: Uploading big.txt may crash your computer - don't do it.
* Analyse the results
